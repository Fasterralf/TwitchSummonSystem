# Enhanced Recovery Logic for TwitchChatService

## Current Problem
When the maximum reconnect attempts (5) are reached, the system gives up permanently and never tries again, even if the network recovers later.

## Solution: Recovery Mode

### 1. New Variables to Add
```csharp
private DateTime _lastSuccessfulConnection = DateTime.MinValue;
private bool _isInRecoveryMode = false;
```

### 2. Enhanced HealthCheck Method
```csharp
private void HealthCheck(object? state)
{
    try
    {
        if (!IsConnected && !_isReconnecting)
        {
            // Standard reconnect logic
            if (!_isInRecoveryMode)
            {
                LogInfo("Health Check: Connection lost - starting reconnect");
                _ = Task.Run(ReconnectAsync);
            }
            else
            {
                // Recovery Mode: Try every 5 minutes with reset attempt counter
                var timeSinceLastAttempt = DateTime.UtcNow - _lastConnectionAttempt;
                if (timeSinceLastAttempt.TotalMinutes >= 5)
                {
                    LogInfo("Health Check: Recovery mode - attempting fresh reconnect");
                    _reconnectAttempts = 0; // Reset attempts for recovery
                    _ = Task.Run(ReconnectAsync);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Success notification when recovering
        if (_isInRecoveryMode && IsConnected)
        {
            LogSuccess("Recovery successful! Chat bot reconnected automatically.");
            _isInRecoveryMode = false;
            _ = Task.Run(async () => 
            {
                await _discordService.SendErrorNotificationAsync(
                    "✅ Chat bot recovered successfully", 
                    "TwitchChatService", 
                    null);
            });
        }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        LogError($"Health Check error: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced ReconnectAsync Method
```csharp
// In ReconnectAsync, replace the max attempts check:
if (_reconnectAttempts >= _maxReconnectAttempts)
{
    LogError($"Maximum reconnect attempts reached ({_maxReconnectAttempts}). Entering recovery mode...");
    _isInRecoveryMode = true;
    
    // Discord notification only on first entry to recovery mode
    if (_reconnectAttempts == _maxReconnectAttempts)
    {
        await _discordService.SendErrorNotificationAsync(
            "Maximum reconnect attempts reached - entering recovery mode", 
            "TwitchChatService", 
            new Exception($"Failed after {_maxReconnectAttempts} attempts"));
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

### 4. Enhanced OnConnected Method
```csharp
private void OnConnected(object? sender, OnConnectedArgs e)
{
    LogSuccess("Chat Bot connected!");
    _isConnected = true;
    _reconnectAttempts = 0;
    _lastConnectionAttempt = DateTime.UtcNow;
    _lastSuccessfulConnection = DateTime.UtcNow;
    _isInRecoveryMode = false; // Exit recovery mode on successful connection
}
```

### 5. Enhanced ForceReconnectAsync Method
```csharp
public async Task<bool> ForceReconnectAsync()
{
    try
    {
        LogInfo("=== Manual Chat-Reconnect started ===");
        _reconnectAttempts = 0; // Reset for manual reconnect
        _isInRecoveryMode = false; // Exit recovery mode for manual attempt
        return await ReconnectAsync();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        await _discordService.SendErrorNotificationAsync("Manual Reconnect Error", "TwitchChatService", ex);
        LogError($"Manual reconnect failed: {ex.Message}");
        return false;
    }
}
```

## How This Solves Your Problem

1. **Recovery Mode**: Instead of giving up after 5 attempts, the system enters "recovery mode"
2. **Periodic Retry**: Every 5 minutes, it resets the attempt counter and tries again
3. **Automatic Notification**: When connection is restored, you get a Discord notification
4. **Manual Override**: The admin panel's manual reconnect bypasses recovery mode
5. **No Spam**: Discord notifications only on mode transitions, not every failed attempt

## Timeline Example

```
15:00 - Connection lost
15:00 - Attempt 1: Failed
15:01 - Attempt 2: Failed  
15:02 - Attempt 3: Failed
15:03 - Attempt 4: Failed
15:04 - Attempt 5: Failed -> Enter Recovery Mode (Discord notification)
15:09 - Recovery attempt 1: Failed (no Discord spam)
15:14 - Recovery attempt 2: Failed  
15:19 - Recovery attempt 3: SUCCESS! (Discord notification: "✅ Recovered")
```

This ensures the system never permanently gives up and you get notified when problems are resolved automatically!
